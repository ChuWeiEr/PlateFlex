PlateFlex is a software for estimating the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere
from the inversion of flexural isostatic response functions calculated from a wavelet
analysis of gravity and topography data.

Installation
------------

Dependencies
++++++++++++

The current version was developed using **Python3.7** \
Also, the following packages are required:

- ``gfortran`` (https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran) (or any Fortran compiler)
- ``numpy`` (https://numpy.org)
- ``pymc3`` (https://docs.pymc.io)
- ``seaborn`` (https://seaborn.pydata.org)

The following package is useful to draw outline of land areas:

- ``scikit-image`` (https://scikit-image.org)

See below for full installation details. 

Download the software
+++++++++++++++++++++

- Clone the repository:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/paudetseis/PlateFlex.git
   cd PlateFlex

Conda environment
+++++++++++++++++

We recommend creating a custom ``conda`` environment
where ``plateflex`` can be installed along with its dependencies.

.. sourcecode:: bash

   conda create -n pflex python=3.7 numpy pymc3 matplotlib seaborn -c conda-forge

or create it from the ``pflex_env.yml`` file:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   conda env create -f pflex_env.yml

Activate the newly created environment:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   conda activate pflex

Installing using pip
++++++++++++++++++++

Once the previous steps are performed, you can install ``plateflex`` using pip:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   pip install .

.. note::

   Please note, if you are actively working on the code, or making frequent edits, it is advisable
   to perform the pip installation with the ``-e`` flag. This enables an editable installation, where
   symbolic links are used rather than straight copies. This means that any changes made in the
   local folders will be reflected in the packages available on the system.
